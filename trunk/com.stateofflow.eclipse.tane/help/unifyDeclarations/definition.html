	    	<i>You have similar local variables declared within clauses of a conditional statement and it would be useful to have
	    	   the assigned values available after the conditional exits.</i>
			</br>&nbsp;
			</br><b>Unify the declarations of the variables by enlarging the scope of the variable so that it is visible in the parent scope
			     of the conditional.</b>

    	<p>This refactoring is most likely to be used as an intermediate step in sequence of refactorings. Enlarging the scope of a variable
    	   is unlikely to be a step that improves maintainability unless it is part of some larger combination that subsequently restores
    	   the focus.</p>
