    	<h1>Reduce Scope - Example</h1>
    	<p>Suppose you have code that looks like this:</p>
    	<div class="code"><pre>
public double[] calculateMeans() {
    double sum;
    double[][] rows = getRows();
    double[] means = new double[rows.length];
    
    for (double[] row : rows) {
        if (row.length == 0)
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("All rows must contain some data");
    }
    
    for (int row = 0 ; row < rows.length ; row++) {
        sum = 0;
        for (double col : rows[row])
            sum += col;
        means[row] = sum / rows[row].length;
    }
    
    return means;
}
    	</pre></div>
		<p>The <span class="code">sum</span> and <span class="code">means</span> variables are declared a long way from their use.
		   It would be better if they were declared just before their uses, so that the code is easier to reason about and so that other
		   refactoring can be applied (<i>e.g.</i> Extract Method) in a way that includes the variable declaration. Applying Reduce Scope
		   and then Join Declaration to <span class="code">sum</span> results in:</p>
    	<div class="code"><pre>
public double[] calculateMeans() {
    double[][] rows = getRows();
    double[] means = new double[rows.length];
    
    for (double[] row : rows) {
        if (row.length == 0)
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("All rows must contain some data");
    }
    
    for (int row = 0 ; row < rows.length ; row++) {
        double sum = 0;
        for (double col : rows[row])
            sum += col;
        means[row] = sum / rows[row].length;
    }
    
    return means;
}
    	</pre></div>

		<p>Attempting to apply Reduce Scope to <span class="code">means</span> results in a warning, because a value that is not a compile time constant
		   is assigned to <span class="code">means</span> at the point of declaration; in principle, moving the declaration of <span class="code">means</span>
		   could result in different behaviour if for example, <span class="code">rows</span> was reassigned or some mutation occurred between
		   the current position where <span class="code">means</span> is declared and the new position. However, in this case, we can see that no
		   behavioural change will occur, so we proceed:</p>
    	<div class="code"><pre>
public double[] calculateMeans() {
    double[][] rows = getRows();
    for (double[] row : rows) {
        if (row.length == 0)
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("All rows must contain some data");
    }
    
    double[] means = new double[rows.length];
    for (int row = 0 ; row < rows.length ; row++) {
        double sum;
        sum = 0;
        for (double col : rows[row])
            sum += col;
        means[row] = sum / rows[row].length;
    }
    
    return means;
}
    	</pre></div>
    	
    	<p>Having moved the declarations of <span class="code">sum</span> and <span class="code">means</span>, we can easily Extract Method one or more
    	   time to further improve the code.</p>
