      Eclipse provides some very good refactorings. Some codebases
that we have &apos;inherited&apos; have needed more than the set of refactorings
provided by Eclipse, so we decided to write those that we thought
would be most beneficial.

Tane is at an early stage of development. We have only implemented
one refactoring and the UI for that is a bit rough around the
edges, but the refactoring does work and is useful. If you are
interested in contributing, either with more refactorings or
by improving the work we&apos;ve started, please 
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/tane-eclipse-refactorings" title="Tane's Google Group">get in touch</a>.

Tane (pronounced &apos;Tah-ney&apos;) is a Polynesian god who lets light
into the world every morning by lifting up a corner of the dark
sky.
