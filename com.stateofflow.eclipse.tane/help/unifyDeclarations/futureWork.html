    	<h1>Unify Declarations - Future Work</h1>
		<p>These may or may not get done as time and interest permits:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Remove the constraint on all variables having the same type and attempt to infer the type to use in the new declaration.</li>
			<li>Remove the constraint on all variables having the same name and allow the user to choose the variables to unify and the new name.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>If you are interested in helping with any of these (or with other enhancements or new refactorings), please
			<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/tane-eclipse-refactorings" title="Tane's Google Group">get in touch</a>.</p>
