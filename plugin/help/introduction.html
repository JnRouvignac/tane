        <title>Tane - Eclipse Refactorings by State Of Flow</title>

    	<h1>Introduction</h1>
    	<p>Eclipse provides some very good refactorings. Some codebases that <a href="http://www.stateofflow.com" title="State Of Flow homepage">we</a>
    		have 'inherited' have needed more than the set of refactorings provided by Eclipse, so we decided to write those that we thought would
    		be most beneficial.</p>
    		
    	<p>Tane is at an early stage of development. We have only implemented one refactoring and the UI for that is a bit rough around the edges,
    		but the refactoring does work and is useful. If you are interested in contributing, either with more refactorings or by improving the
    		work we've started, please get in touch via the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tane/" title="Tane's googlecode website">website</a>.</p>

		<p>Tane (pronounced '<b>Tah</b>-ney') is a Polynesian god who lets light into the world every morning by lifting up a corner of the dark sky.</p>
